##Overview

The Varnish module installs, configures, and manages the varnish service.

##Module Description

The Varnish module handles running the Varnish caching system on your server.

##Setup

###What varnish affects

* varnish package.
* varnish configuration file.
* varnish service.

###Beginning with varnish

include '::varnish' is enough to get you up and running.  If you wish to pass in
parameters like which servers to use then you can use:

```puppet
class { '::varnish':
  servers => [ 'varnish1.corp.com', 'varnish2.corp.com' ],
}
```

##Usage

All interaction with the varnish module can do be done through the main varnish class.
This means you can simply toggle the options in the varnish class to get at the
full functionality.

###I just want varnish, what's the minimum I need?

```puppet
include '::varnish'
```

###I just want to tweak the servers, nothing else.

```puppet
class { '::varnish':
  servers => [ 'varnish1.corp.com', 'varnish2.corp.com' ],
}
```

###I'd like to make sure I restrict who can connect as well.

```puppet
class { '::varnish':
  servers  => [ 'varnish1.corp.com', 'varnish2.corp.com' ],
  restrict => 'restrict 127.0.0.1',
}
```

###I'd like to opt out of having the service controlled, we use another tool for that.

```puppet
class { '::varnish':
  servers        => [ 'varnish1.corp.com', 'varnish2.corp.com' ],
  restrict       => 'restrict 127.0.0.1',
  manage_service => false,
}
```

###Looks great!  But I'd like a different template, we need to do something unique here.

```puppet
class { '::varnish':
  servers         => [ 'varnish1.corp.com', 'varnish2.corp.com' ],
  restrict        => 'restrict 127.0.0.1',
  manage_service  => false,
  config_template => 'different/module/custom.template.erb',
}
```

##Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 2.7 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 5/6
* Debian 6/7
* CentOS 5/6
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Gentoo
* Arch Linux
* FreeBSD

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed. 

##Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community
contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the
huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment
configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)
